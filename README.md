## Instructions

Flip the cards on the board to collect matches. The more cards you match, the more stars you collect. You win the game when you find all 16 card matches in 32 moves or less. To start the game again, click the restart button or hit Play Again when the button appears. 

To get started, open `index.html` and start playing.
